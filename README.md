# vk-hotkeys

Minimalistic Chrome extension that binds arrow keys with the save/remove photo and like/dislike buttons.

With an image open in vk, press
- Up Key: add or remove like
- Down Key: save the image to "Saved Photos" album or remove the image  
  Since you cannot re-save what's already "yours" and remove what's not, using the same button did not seem to be a bad idea
